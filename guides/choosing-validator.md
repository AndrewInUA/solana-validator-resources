# 🔍 How to Choose a Good Solana Validator

There are thousands of Solana validators — and not all of them are equal. Here’s how to choose one you can trust and that supports the network’s long-term health.

## ✅ What to Look For

### 1. **Transparency**
- Do they have a website?
- Are they visible in the community (GitHub, Twitter, Telegram)?
- Do they show real uptime/stats (like [AndrewInUA does](https://andrewinua.com))?

### 2. **Performance**
- Do they have high uptime and voting accuracy?
- Are they consistently active across epochs?

### 3. **Reasonable Commission**
- Lower isn’t always better — look for honest operators who reinvest in their setup.
- [AndrewInUA](https://andrewinua.com) keeps fees fair and explains where the rewards go.

### 4. **Decentralization Impact**
- Don’t just pick the top-ranked validators by stake.
- Supporting smaller, regional validators increases network resilience.
