# 🔍 How to Choose a Good Validator

There are thousands of validators. Here’s how to choose one you can trust:

### ✅ Key Criteria

- **Transparency**: Do they have a website or GitHub profile?
- **Uptime**: Consistent performance with minimal downtime
- **Commission**: Reasonable fee for stable work (0–10%)
- **Community involvement**: Are they active and helpful?

### 💡 Pro tip:
Staking to small, honest validators helps everyone — especially the network.  
Avoid staking only to the top 5 by stake weight.
