# 🧭 Delegation vs Validation on Solana

New to staking? This guide explains the difference between two key roles in the Solana ecosystem — **delegators** and **validators**.

---

## 🤝 Delegators

**Delegators** are SOL holders who want to support the network without running any hardware or infrastructure.

### What they do:
- Choose a **trusted validator**
- Delegate their SOL (stake)
- Earn rewards based on uptime and performance

### Benefits:
- Easy to start via wallets like Phantom or Solflare
- No technical skills required
- Help secure and decentralize the network

---

## 🛠 Validators

**Validators** run the infrastructure that powers Solana. They:
- Validate transactions and produce blocks
- Maintain high uptime and connectivity
- Compete for stake delegation

### Requirements:
- High-performance server setup
- Constant monitoring and maintenance
- Technical knowledge of Solana CLI, updates, and network behavior

## 🧠 TL;DR

| Role       | Key Action        | Required Skills     | Risk Level     |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Delegator  | Stake your SOL    | None                 | Low            |
| Validator  | Run a node        | High technical skill | Medium to high |
