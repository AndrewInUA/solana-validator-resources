# ⚙️ How Solana Works (Simple Explanation)

Solana is a fast, decentralized blockchain designed to handle thousands of transactions per second — without sacrificing security or cost-efficiency.

This guide explains how it all works in plain language.

## ⏱️ Speed with Proof of History (PoH)

Unlike most blockchains, Solana uses a unique idea called **Proof of History**.  
It's like a built-in clock that lets validators process transactions in order — super fast.

- Solana doesn't wait for global consensus before moving forward.
- Transactions are verified in parallel — not one by one.
- This makes the network fast and scalable.

## 🛠 Validators Do the Work

Solana is maintained by a network of **validators** — operators who run nodes and verify blocks.  
They earn rewards and help secure the network.

- The more stake a validator gets, the more likely they are to produce blocks.
- Stake comes from delegators (like you!).

## 🤝 Delegators Support the Network

**Delegators** are SOL holders who choose a validator to support.  
You don’t run a server — you just stake your tokens and earn a share of the rewards.

## 📉 Fees Stay Low

Because of its efficient design, Solana can keep fees extremely low — often just a fraction of a cent.

## 🧠 TL;DR

| Feature             | Solana Advantage                    |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Consensus Mechanism | Proof of History + Proof of Stake   |
| Speed               | Thousands of TPS (transactions/sec) |
| Fees                | Ultra-low, even under high load     |
| Security            | Maintained by independent validators |
| Delegation          | Easy via wallets like Phantom       |

> Solana works best when more people participate — whether you're running a validator or just [staking SOL](https://andrewinua.com/#delegate), you're part of a powerful network. 💪
