# ❓ Solana Validator FAQ

Here are answers to common questions from delegators and new validator operators in the Solana ecosystem.

---

### ❓ What is a validator?

A validator is a machine (run by a person or team) that helps verify transactions and produce new blocks on the Solana blockchain.

---

### ❓ Can anyone run a validator?

Technically, yes — Solana is permissionless.  
But you’ll need a strong server, some technical skill, and time for ongoing maintenance.

---

### ❓ Do I need to run a validator to earn rewards?

No!  
You can earn rewards just by [staking your SOL](https://andrewinua.com/#delegate) to a trusted validator like AndrewInUA. It’s easy and secure.

---

### ❓ How do I choose a validator?

Look for validators with:
- High uptime
- Transparent communication
- Fair commission
- Community presence (like [AndrewInUA](https://andrewinua.com))

---

### ❓ What risks should I know about?

- Validators can get slashed if they behave badly — but this is rare on Solana.
- Delegating SOL doesn’t transfer ownership — your funds stay in your wallet.
