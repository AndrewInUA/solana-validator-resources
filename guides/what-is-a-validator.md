# 🧩 What Is a Validator?

A **validator** is a computer (node) in the Solana blockchain network that validates transactions and helps maintain the network.

Validators:
- Confirm new blocks and secure the ledger
- Earn rewards through transaction fees and inflation
- Help keep the Solana network decentralized

### 🔍 Why Validators Matter

Without validators, Solana wouldn’t be fast or secure. They’re essential to:
- Processing millions of transactions
- Preventing double-spending and attacks
- Allowing true decentralization without a central authority

### 🌱 Want to support decentralization?

Stake your SOL to smaller, transparent validators like [**AndrewInUA**](https://andrewinua.com/#stake) instead of only choosing the biggest ones.
That way, you help protect the network from centralization risks.
