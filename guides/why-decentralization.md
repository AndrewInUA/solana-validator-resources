# 🌐 Why Decentralization Matters

Blockchains are only as strong as their validator set.

If most SOL is staked to just a few validators:
- The network becomes vulnerable to censorship
- It creates central points of failure
- It weakens community power

### 🤝 Your Role

When you stake to smaller, community-first validators like [**AndrewInUA**](https://andrewinua.com/#stake), you:
- Help decentralize Solana
- Support independent infrastructure
- Keep the network diverse, global, and secure
